# Dynamic Traffic Light System
> Welcome to the github repo of our Dynamic Traffic Light System project!
> This innoative solution was developed as part of the Semicolon Hackathon, co-partnered by Major League Hacking (MLH)

### Project Overview:
The Dynamic Traffic Light System is an IoT-powered solution designed to improve traffic management by dynamically adjusting traffic signal timings based on vehicle density.

Key features include:
- Vehicle Density Detection: IoT sensors monitor real-time traffic density at intersections.
- Camera-based Vehicle Detection: Utilizing OpenCV, the system detects vehicles via a camera and counts them for additional accuracy.
- Dynamic Signal Control: Traffic lights are adjusted automatically based on analyzed data to reduce congestion.
